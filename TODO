A lot of things TODO as the tool is in its beta dev phase,
and I still experiment with the concept behind the tool.

I'll start implementing the basic features that a post exploitation 
tool needs (Stealth Behavior, Encryption, Various Payload Formats etc),
and continue with usuability and optimization features.
